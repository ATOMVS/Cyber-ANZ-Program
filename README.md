# Cyber@ANZ-Program
This is a Virtual Experience offered by ANZ which gives a insight at ANZ workplace. A virtual work experience program is an online course that simulates what you would do at a company if you worked there day-to-day. These programs include cases of the actual tasks a professional would do with real customers and clients. There were 2 tasks which we completed while gaining some skills:

Task 1 - Social Engineering Investigation

Task 2 - Digital investigation
